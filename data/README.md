*Place all `*.RDS` and/or `*.so6` files in this directory*

- You can download the original unprocessed `*.so6` files from EUROCONTROL's [DDR2](https://ext.eurocontrol.int/ddr/) (Demand Data Repository)
- You can use processed `*.RDS` files for better performance, as long as they follow the `YYYYMMDD_YYYYMMDD.RDS` format
- You will also need an `airlines.RDS` file that includes the existing airlines flying to Europe by month
